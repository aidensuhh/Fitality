# Fitality - Financial Health Tracker for University Students

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

- This project was inspired by people in the society, especially university students who just turned 18 and are now on their own for the first time, and don't have a clear picture of their financial health, and don't know where to start improving it.
- This project, as a solution, is an AI-powered gamified web app financial health tracker to calculates and evaluates "Financial Health Score" based on how the AI analyzes student's financial life, including income, expenses, savings, debt, and investments. The AI can suggest ways to improve the score and offer personalized tips for financial growth, as well as offering progress tracking and educational modules on financial literacy to also serve as an educational platform that empowers students to make smarter financial decisions.
- Input data: The app collects key data from students such as their income (allowance, part-time job, etc.), expenses (tuition, food, rent, etc.), savings (bank balances, emergency funds), debts (student loans, credit cards, etc.), and investments.
- Score Model: Using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or even Deep Neural Networks (DNN), the model can combine multiple factors (income, expenses, savings, etc.) to generate a Financial Health Score ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents excellent financial health.
- Personalized Recommendations:

    AI will analyze the studentâ€™s financial habits and give advice such as:
        How much to save each month to build an emergency fund.
        If the student is overspending in certain categories (food, entertainment, etc.).
        Whether they should prioritize paying off debts (e.g., credit cards or student loans) over saving.
        Investing tips based on available disposable income.

Progress Tracking:

The system will allow students to track changes in their financial health over time.
    Monthly or quarterly progress reviews will provide insights into how their score has changed based on their financial decisions.
    Visual charts and graphs to show trends in savings, spending, debt reduction, etc.

Educational Content & Financial Literacy:

The app could feature built-in modules or articles explaining basic financial principles such as credit scores, how interest rates work, debt repayment strategies, etc.
    A gamification feature where students earn badges or rewards as they improve their financial habits (e.g., "Debt Destroyer" for paying off a credit card).

Real-Time Notifications:

Alert students when they are nearing their spending limits.
    Send periodic reminders to save or pay down debt.
    Offer motivational messages when they improve their Financial Health Score.

Model Development:

You can follow this approach for building the model:

Data Collection:
        Collect data (preferably anonymized) from students regarding their income, expenses, savings, debt, and any other financial habits.
        If real-world data isn't available, consider generating synthetic datasets that simulate student financial behaviors (e.g., income from part-time jobs, spending on textbooks, etc.).
    Preprocessing:
        Clean and normalize the data. For example, transform income/expenses into monthly amounts and categorize expenses into relevant categories (e.g., food, entertainment, utilities).
        Handle missing data, remove outliers, and convert categorical data (like types of expenses) into numerical form.
    Model Selection:
        Start with simple models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machines for regression-based prediction (e.g., predicting the Financial Health Score).
        Train on different features: income, expenses, savings, credit score, debts, etc., to build a composite score.
    Model Evaluation:
        Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or RÂ² to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
        Consider using cross-validation to check the robustness of the model.

   Recommendations Generation:
        Once you have a prediction model, create recommendation logic based on thresholds of the financial health score:
            If the score is low, suggest debt repayment strategies or savings tips.
            If the score is high, suggest investment strategies or more advanced savings tips.
